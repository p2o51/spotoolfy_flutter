# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/examples/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/icons/adaptive_icon_monochrome.png
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Spotify Mix
      fonts:
        # Light - FontWeight.w300
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        # Regular - FontWeight.w400 或 FontWeight.normal
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        # Medium - FontWeight.w500
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        # Bold - FontWeight.w700 或 FontWeight.bold
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        # Extrabold - FontWeight.w800
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-Extrabold.ttf
          weight: 800
        # Italic - 常规斜体
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpotifyMix-RegularItalic.ttf
          weight: 400
          style: italic
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        # 常规 (Regular) - 对应 FontWeight.w400 或 FontWeight.normal
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
          weight: 400
        # 粗体 (Bold) - 对应 FontWeight.w700 或 FontWeight.bold
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 700
        # 斜体 (Italic)
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Italic.ttf

          # 如果斜体也有不同字重，也需要指定 weight，否则默认为 400
