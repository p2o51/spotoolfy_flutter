## Notes for Questionnaire

1. **Third-party content disclaimer**: While Spotoolfy displays lyrics from third-party sources, we do not create or control this content. Lyrics may occasionally contain mature themes as they are user-generated on external platforms.

2. **AI-generated content**: The app uses Google Gemini for translations, which is subject to Google's content policies and safety filters.

3. **Spotify integration**: All music content is streamed through Spotify and subject to Spotify's content policies.

---

## App Access for Review

If Google Play review team needs to test the app:

1. **Spotify Premium account required**: The app requires a Spotify Premium account for playback features
2. **API keys optional**: AI translation features require a Gemini API key, but the app functions without it
3. **Test credentials**: [Provide test account if available, or note that reviewers need their own Spotify Premium account]

### Demo Mode Suggestion
Consider adding a demo mode for reviewers that shows sample functionality without requiring Spotify authentication.
